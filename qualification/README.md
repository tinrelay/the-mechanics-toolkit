# Maintainer platform qualification

These runbooks are for toolkit maintainers and agents actively porting or validating TMTK with
explicit authority to replace the canonical installed application. They are not part of ordinary
installation. Some capability phases deliberately install a broken application and require a
technical operator, a verified restoration source, and a witnessed recovery seam.

An agent adopting an already-qualified patchset should read the public
[`extraction ledger`](../docs/extraction-ledger.md), its qualification-bearing commit, and the
selected patch READMEs; raw maintainer receipts under ignored `.work/` state are not published.
Stage from the matching pristine vendor build, perform the healthy restart and selected-feature
acceptance checks, and stop there. Do not manufacture blank or Oops failures for an ordinary user.
Only a maintainer qualifying a changed supervisor boundary runs those destructive capability phases.

Desktop qualification is platform-specific. A patch may carry earlier live evidence only when its
current semantic owner and behavior remain equivalent; changed, uncertain, or newly composed seams
require a current live check. Generated JavaScript may share substantial structure, but packaging,
signing, process discovery, application shutdown, terminal rescue, storage, and native-module
behavior do not. A platform is qualified only by its own runbook and receipt.

The [current build matrix](../docs/extraction-ledger.md#current-build-matrix) is the sole summary of
which platform checkpoints are current. This index does not duplicate fast-changing status.

Transform recognition on another package is portability evidence, not platform qualification.
