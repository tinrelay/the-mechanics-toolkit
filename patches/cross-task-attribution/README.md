# Cross-task attribution

- **Current state:** Active
- **Public extraction:** Complete for the current renderer family
- **Fleet qualification:** See the [extraction ledger](../../docs/extraction-ledger.md).

## Why it exists

A message arriving from another task should say who sent it. Stock Codex renders a generic
“another task” label even though the delegated-message record already carries the source task ID
and preserves click-through to it. That forces a human to infer identity from prose or open the
link—precisely when several agents may be coordinating at once.

This patch resolves the source task through Codex's own renderer store and replaces the generic
label with the name before a title's ` — ` separator. An ordinary task uses
`project/task title` when its project context is available (for example,
`ganglion/ticket-inbox`); otherwise it keeps the complete task title. If authoritative title
metadata is missing it keeps the stock generic label. It never parses message prose as identity.
The same formatter is published to outgoing receipts and wait rosters. The sender name has
its own semantic marker so the visual palette can color only the identity while the surrounding
native attribution text keeps its stock metadata color.

The patch also applies Codex's existing muted semantic accent only to the delegated user-message
bubble. It does not tint the whole turn, dim text, or remove the source-task link.

*The sender is visible at the point where provenance matters.*

## Owned seam

The transform recognizes one delegated-message renderer owner, its wrapper, its user-message bubble,
and the stock ESM exports for the renderer store, scope, and title atom. It imports those existing
owners into the lazy chunk and adjusts the exact memo-cache dependencies that consume the new label
and style prop.

Missing, duplicated, partial, or changed owners stop with `Upstream changed`. The transform does not
inject a second state store, private selector initialization, or a title registry.

## Check and apply

```sh
node bin/toolkit.mjs patch cross-task-attribution check /path/to/extracted-asar
node bin/toolkit.mjs patch cross-task-attribution apply /path/to/disposable-extracted-asar
node test/cross-task-attribution.test.mjs /path/to/disposable-extracted-asar
```

No configuration is required. The patch command modifies only the supplied extracted tree. The
separate staging command can build and statically verify a new app outside `/Applications`; neither
command installs, launches, or replaces a working application.

## Verification

`test/cross-task-attribution-transform.test.mjs` builds a synthetic pristine renderer graph with
stock ESM ownership and exact current lazy-chunk seams. It proves the red/green transform, source
name extraction, stock-store ownership, generic fallback color, preserved click-through,
bubble-only styling, untouched dependency owners, syntax validity, and byte-identical second
application.

The palette transform fixture applies this public patch first, then proves that palette provenance
composition still works. Current package and live evidence belongs in the fleet
[extraction ledger](../../docs/extraction-ledger.md).

## Non-goals

- deriving identity from message text or correspondence headers;
- inventing a sender when source metadata is absent;
- changing routing, delivery, or task hydration;
- recoloring ordinary local user messages;
- replacing the task visual palette;
- accepting an approximately matching future renderer.
