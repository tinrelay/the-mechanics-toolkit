# Model identity guard

- **Current state:** Active
- **Public extraction:** Complete for the standalone transform
- **Fleet qualification:** See the [extraction ledger](../../docs/extraction-ledger.md).

## Why it exists

Codex can hydrate a continuing task with a different model or reasoning effort while truthfully
showing that new selection in the composer. For a continuity-bearing agent, noticing the change
after several turns is too late. This patch compares the live selector state with an independent,
exact-task pin and fails loudly before another message can be entered.

This is based on observed failures: Codex has changed the selected model or effort without the user
doing so, most often around application restarts. The guard independently states what the task was
supposed to use so the truthful-but-wrong live selector cannot silently redefine the expectation.

On mismatch, the existing model selector flashes red and displays `BAD MODEL`, its tooltip names
the expected and current model/effort pair, and the composer editor is disabled. The disabled
editor visibly names the expected pair and tells the operator to restore it. The selector stays
usable; matching the pin immediately returns the editor and any existing draft to normal.
If the pinned model was removed or renamed, hold `⌘` and click either the locked composer message or
`BAD MODEL` on macOS; hold Control and click either surface on Windows or Linux. That disables the
lockout for this task until the application exits without rewriting its JSON pin. The alert and
recovery text retain deliberate warning contrast in both Codex themes.

*The task remains readable, but another message cannot be sent until the pinned model and effort
are restored.*

## Configuration

The patch consumes an optional `modelPin` from an exact-ID
[agent roster](../agent-roster/) entry:

```json
{
  "name": "Engine Tender",
  "taskId": "22222222-2222-4222-8222-222222222222",
  "modelPin": {
    "model": "gpt-5.6-sol",
    "reasoningEffort": "high"
  }
}
```

Model values use Codex's stable internal IDs. Effort accepts `none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`,
`high`, `xhigh`, `max`, `ultra`, or `persistent`. A pin requires an exact `taskId`; titles and
regular-expression matches never assign this safety policy by themselves. Unknown or malformed
configuration leaves the last valid roster in force when runtime reload is enabled.

## Owned seam

The transform recognizes the current owner that jointly holds the displayed model and normalized
reasoning effort. A small React effect publishes that exact live pair to a DOM guard.
The guard scopes itself to the existing composer root inside the exact task room and uses the stock
model selector as the repair control. A transient composer withdrawal, including switching into
Dictate, supplies no contrary model evidence and does not trigger the guard; a concrete published
model or effort must disagree with the pin. Its DOM observer ignores ordinary transcript mutations
and rescans only when a task room, model selector, or composer surface is newly mounted.

This patch requires agent-roster for exact-ID validation, runtime reload, and subscription. It
remains separate so roster identity does not imply model enforcement.

## Check and apply

```sh
node bin/toolkit.mjs patch model-identity-guard check /path/to/extracted-asar
node bin/toolkit.mjs patch model-identity-guard apply /path/to/disposable-extracted-asar
node test/model-identity-guard.test.mjs /path/to/disposable-extracted-asar
```

Apply task-visual-palette first. The transform modifies only the supplied extracted tree; staging
and application replacement remain separate operations.

## Verification

`test/model-identity-guard-transform.test.mjs` proves prerequisite refusal, exact current
ownership, syntax, idempotence, and the focused behavioral
probe. The behavioral probe verifies exact model-and-effort comparison, visible expected/current
diagnostics, the in-editor recovery instruction, draft-preserving editor lock, submit suppression,
selector availability, platform-native session override from both clickable surfaces, recovery
after the live pair matches, no false alert while the composer publication is transiently absent,
and stock behavior for an unpinned task. It also checks the light-theme
recovery treatment rather than assuming the dark warning color will remain readable on a pale
composer.

## Non-goals

- selecting a model automatically;
- trusting a title as identity;
- hiding what Codex actually selected;
- blocking the model selector or the in-progress Stop action;
- changing provider availability, budgets, or model routing;
- accepting an approximately matching future build.
