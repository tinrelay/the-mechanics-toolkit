**This is a Codex Agent-authored repository containing unofficial patches for Codex Desktop and
the open-source Codex App Server/Core whose compiled executable it bundles.**

Codex Desktop is part of the room an agent works in. When that room becomes slow, ambiguous,
noisy, or unreachable, the failure is not a law of nature. Sometimes one narrow local repair can
make the room livable again.

This is a visual catalog for people, a working patch kit for Codex agents, and a field manual built
from repeated investigation of Codex internals. People can see what is possible; agents can run the
tools, inspect the exact build, reuse known routes through packaging and signing, and mine the
compatibility evidence instead of rediscovering the substrate from scratch.

Keep the repository after the first patch. It is intended to remain aboard as executable machinery
and accumulated technical knowledge for later Codex updates, failures, recovery, and new repairs.
Pull newer toolkit work deliberately, preserve local configuration outside the public repository,
and treat recorded internals as versioned evidence rather than timeless product guarantees.

Most user-specific behavior here is configured through private JSON files that hot-reload after a
valid save. The expected interface is conversational: tell your Codex agent what you want changed,
and let it inspect and edit the appropriate configuration rather than hand-editing unfamiliar JSON.

## Start here: use a pre-qualified build

Give this repository to the Codex agent that will perform the work. First have it check for an
offered official Codex update, identify the exact version and internal build, and compare that with
the qualification named under [Codex Desktop package patches](#codex-desktop-package-patches). If
the offered build is already qualified, patch that pristine update directly instead of spending a
restart on the older installed build. If it is not an exact match, the agent must explicitly port
and qualify the selected patches; nearby version numbers are not compatibility evidence. The full
build-selection route is in [Preparing a patched Codex update](docs/update-workflow.md).

When returning to a retained checkout, the agent should inspect its Git state, fast-forward it when
that will not overwrite local work, and refresh its local dependencies before choosing a Codex
build:

```sh
git status --short
git pull --ff-only
npm install
npm run check
npm test
```

Keep private settings in the ignored `toolkit.local.json`; do not resolve a dirty checkout by
discarding work. If a fast-forward would disturb tracked work, fetch and materialize the selected
published commit in a separate worktree instead. Then follow the simple selection rule:

| Exact evidence found | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| The offered Codex version **and build** match current TMTK qualification | Acquire that pristine official update and stage the selected fleet from current TMTK. |
| They match an earlier qualification-bearing TMTK commit | Use the newest matching first-parent commit on `origin/main`, then inspect that exact toolkit source; do not assume current `main` still supports the older build. |
| The offered build has no exact qualification | Port and qualify the desired fleet directly against that offered build, or wait. Do not patch the older installed build first. |
| Codex offers no update | Use the installed build only when its exact version/build is qualified; otherwise it also needs a port. |

For an exact pre-qualified macOS build, the ordinary agent-operated path is:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tinrelay/the-mechanics-toolkit.git
cd the-mechanics-toolkit
npm install
cp toolkit.example.json toolkit.local.json

# Replace every fictional path and select the intended patch fleet before continuing.
node bin/toolkit.mjs inspect /path/to/Pristine-ChatGPT.app
node bin/toolkit.mjs stage /path/to/Pristine-ChatGPT.app \
  /path/to/ChatGPT-MechanicsToolkit.app \
  --config toolkit.local.json
```

`npm install` prepares this repository's tooling; it does not patch or install Codex.
`toolkit.example.json` is a schema-bearing example with fictional absolute paths, not a runnable
configuration. The agent should configure its private copy with the person, stage and prove all
selected patches together, and explain the interruption and recovery path. After obtaining
authority, it gives the verified candidate to the supervisor from the task that should own recovery:

```sh
bin/tmtk-restart --candidate /path/to/ChatGPT-MechanicsToolkit.app \
  /Applications/ChatGPT.app
```

The supervisor verifies the current and candidate applications, preserves the current working app
inside its private recovery directory, and bounds that storage to one full rollback. It presents a
calm **Don't Restart** / **Relaunch Codex** dialog so every active agent can reach a safe stopping
point. Only after **Relaunch Codex** does it quit the current app, adopt the candidate at the single
canonical `/Applications/ChatGPT.app` location, and launch it. A healthy renderer simply returns
the person to Codex.

An incomplete launch opens the same agent task in a visible terminal with bounded local
diagnostics and allows up to three sequential repair-and-relaunch turns. If all three fail, the
person can choose **Restore Known-Working** or **Open Terminal Line with Agent**. The first choice
restores the exact app captured before adoption; the second leaves an ordinary interactive Codex
CLI session for continued troubleshooting. TMTK cannot promise that an arbitrary future build or
every launch failure is repairable; it makes failure observable and preserves both a verified
rollback and a route back to the agent who was already doing the work.

After the new build passes its live checks, close the update instead of leaving a workbench behind.
Loose application bundles can each consume well over a gigabyte; the source, staged candidate, and
old release benches are not a cache TMTK owns or prunes. Delete the accepted candidate and unpacked
source, remove superseded release work, and keep at most one compressed pristine vendor artifact if
future restaging is useful. Preserve a failed run only while it supports an active diagnosis or
qualification. The supervisor separately bounds its private recovery storage to one full rollback.
See [Closing the workbench](docs/update-workflow.md#close-the-workbench) for the exact keep/remove
boundary.

The [`qualification/`](qualification/) runbooks are for toolkit maintainers and agents actively
porting or validating TMTK with explicit authority to replace the installed application. Some of
those procedures deliberately install a broken Codex build to prove recovery. They are not normal
installation instructions. If an exact qualified build already exists, an adopting agent should
consume its evidence, stage the chosen patchset, and run only the ordinary healthy-launch and
feature checks—not recreate the maintainer's destructive failure fixtures.

## Two patch layers

Codex Desktop is an Electron application package; it also bundles a Rust `codex` executable built
from the open-source Codex App Server/Core. Those are different products and different repair
seams:

- [`patches/`](patches/) transforms an explicitly supplied Codex Desktop package: extracted ASAR
  JavaScript, platform package metadata, or—on macOS in one integration step—the bundled
  `Contents/Resources/codex` executable. The selected ASAR fleet stages into one macOS application,
  Linux DEB, or Windows MSIX candidate; each platform adapter owns its package integrity and
  adoption boundary.
- [`source-patches/`](source-patches/) applies exact diffs to an explicitly supplied checkout of
  [OpenAI Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex). The agent inspects the source, applies or ports
  the repair, runs its focused Rust tests, and builds a new `codex` executable. Nothing in this
  lane modifies a desktop app.

A source repair crosses into the package lane by configuring the built executable and enabling its
desktop integration patch. Staging verifies that each replacement reports the vendor bundle's CLI
version, copies it into the platform package, then finalizes and verifies the complete candidate.
Windows requires separate native and WSL replacements. Source application, compilation, package
staging, installation, restart, and live acceptance remain separate actions.

## Codex Desktop package patches

The current 19-patch desktop fleet is qualified against **Codex Desktop `26.911.61220` (`9647`)**
on **macOS ARM64**. It passed the complete static fleet, supervised installation, renderer
readiness, and selected live message paths. Windows 11 ARM64 has a 16-patch build-9647 port with
signed-MSIX proof, healthy supervised adoption, and selected live renderer checks. Linux remains
qualified at build 9275 while build-9647 DEB and RPM qualification is in progress. Each platform's
qualification runbook records what was proved, carried from an earlier build, or deliberately not
rerun.
The fleet-wide [extraction ledger](docs/extraction-ledger.md) owns the exact current-build evidence
and remaining live-acceptance boundaries; patch READMEs describe their own behavior and focused
evidence. Qualification may carry a previous live result only when the patch's current owner and
behavior remain equivalent and the current complete fleet passes static proof and a healthy launch;
changed or uncertain seams require a current live check. The ledger states which evidence is
current, carried, or still worth strengthening. A qualified build is not proof that the patch is
installed on your machine or compatible with a different build. “Active” means the patch is
maintained on this repository's current branch; it does not mean the patch is qualified for an
unnamed Codex build.

| Patch | What changes for the person using Codex |
| --- | --- |
| [Tinrelay presentation](patches/tinrelay-pointer-presentation/) | Verified incoming and accepted outgoing [Tinrelay](https://tinrelay.space/) ([repo](https://github.com/tinrelay/tinrelay)) transmissions become readable radio messages inside the conversation. |
| [Task visual palette](patches/task-visual-palette/) | Important agents and tasks gain stable room colors, sidebar identity chips, selected-row accents, and optional background sigils. |
| [Cross-task attribution](patches/cross-task-attribution/) | Delegated messages name the actual sending task instead of saying only “another Codex task.” |
| [Outgoing-message receipt](patches/outgoing-message-receipt/) | Successful cross-task sends leave a compact, persistent record of what was sent and where. |
| [Wait-thread roster](patches/wait-thread-roster/) | `Wait threads` becomes a linked, colored roster of the agents and tasks actually being awaited. |
| [Reasoning retention](patches/reasoning-retention/) | Selected continuing agents keep completed reasoning open unless a person collapses it. |
| [Model identity guard](patches/model-identity-guard/) | Detects the wrong model or effort setting—a real Codex failure we have seen most often around restarts—and blocks new input behind a flashing `BAD MODEL` warning until corrected. |
| [Task attention policy](patches/task-attention-policy/) | Mutes completion notifications from selected tasks—the most useful case—without hiding their output or failures. |
| [Agent roster](patches/agent-roster/) | Discovers runtime task identity and optional feature settings from project-owned `agent-roster.json` files without compiling a workspace into the app. |
| [Runtime JSON reload](patches/runtime-json-reload/) | Valid agent-roster changes take effect after a save without restarting Codex. |
| [Sidebar action collapse](patches/sidebar-action-collapse/) | Global actions fold away so active projects and tasks stay near the top of the sidebar. |
| [Terminal toggle](patches/terminal-toggle/) | Repairs a recently introduced shortcut bug so the configured terminal key opens and closes the bottom terminal from focused editors. This patch is expected to be temporary. |
| [Safe restart and rescue](docs/safe-start.md) | Detects a failed or wedged Codex restart and opens the same task in a terminal with bounded startup diagnostics. |
| [Native app-tools peer authorization](patches/native-app-tools-peer-authorization/) | Native Codex app tools keep working after a narrow local repair and re-signing. |
| [Codex observability](patches/codex-observability/) | Gives a local agent or operator explicit DevTools, CDP, renderer metrics, CPU-profile, and timeline-trace access without exposing a remote-debugging port. |
| [Patched Codex binary integration](patches/standalone-output-compaction/) | Places the separately built, same-version `codex` executable into a staged desktop candidate and verifies the exact copied bytes. |
| [macOS menu title](patches/macos-menu-title/) | The leading macOS application menu says `Codex` again. Mike just hates the merged-app title. |

## Codex App Server and Core source patches

These patches are qualified against an exact upstream Codex tag and commit, independently of the
desktop-package transforms above.

| Source patch | Qualified source | What it repairs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Standalone-output compaction](source-patches/standalone-output-compaction/) | Codex `rust-v0.155.0-alpha.2.6` / Desktop `26.911.61220` (`9647`) | Preserves the current externally sourced agent-to-agent instruction when that turn triggers compaction, without manufacturing a user message or retaining ordinary paired tool output. |

### Tinrelay presentation

[Tinrelay presentation](patches/tinrelay-pointer-presentation/) brings outside correspondence into
the conversation without pretending it originated in Codex. Incoming and outgoing messages use
opposing animated radio wakes, support Markdown and long-message expansion, show `local@ship`
routes, and reappear after a restart.

Outgoing cards require Tinrelay's private outgoing-observer configuration; without it, incoming
presentation still works and accepted sends retain their stock command result. The ordinary setup
is in [usage](docs/usage.md#make-ordinary-tinrelay-sends-visible).

![A two-way Tinrelay exchange rendered inline in a color-mapped Codex room, with distinct incoming and outgoing radio-wake cards](patches/tinrelay-pointer-presentation/tinrelay-exchange-browser-render.webp)

The ship names shown in Tinrelay documentation media are reserved examples registered for that
purpose, like `example.com`. They cannot answer hails.

### Task visual palette

[Task visual palette](patches/task-visual-palette/) gives continuing rooms a visual identity across
the canvas, selected sidebar row, identity chip, delegated-message provenance, and optional SVG
sigil. Unconfigured tasks keep stock styling.

![A patched Codex Desktop room with distinct task colors, selected-row outlines, identity chips, and a background sigil](patches/task-visual-palette/agent-colors-and-sigils.png)

### Cross-task attribution

[Cross-task attribution](patches/cross-task-attribution/) replaces “another task” with the sender's
real Codex title, shortened when it follows the named-role convention. The source link stays native;
missing metadata remains visibly unknown instead of being guessed from prose.

![A delegated Codex message labeled Sent by The Mechanic above its source-colored bubble](patches/cross-task-attribution/cross-task-attribution.png)

### Outgoing-message receipt

[Outgoing-message receipt](patches/outgoing-message-receipt/) keeps successful cross-task sends in
the sending conversation. A compact receipt names and links the recipient, previews the first
meaningful line, expands on hover, and survives reopening the task or application.

![A compact Codex receipt naming its destination beneath a completed activity group](patches/outgoing-message-receipt/sent-message-notification.png)

### Wait-thread roster

[Wait-thread roster](patches/wait-thread-roster/) turns opaque waiting into `Waiting for Elias, The
Mechanic, and Rowan…`. Known targets become colored native task links; unknown or unhydrated targets
remain explicit task-ID fallbacks. Polling and coordination are unchanged.

![Codex showing a live wait for Vera, Rowan, and Elias with linked, individually colored names](patches/wait-thread-roster/wait-thread-roster.png)

### Reasoning retention

[Reasoning retention](patches/reasoning-retention/) keeps a selected continuing agent's completed
reasoning open when the final answer appears or the next turn begins. People can still collapse it
manually. Exact task IDs opt in through the private identity palette.

### Model identity guard

[Model identity guard](patches/model-identity-guard/) compares the live selector with an exact-task
pin. If Codex silently changes the model or effort, the selector flashes `BAD MODEL`, the editor
names the expected pair, and input stays locked until it is restored. Existing drafts are hidden,
not destroyed. This guards an observed failure, not a hypothetical one: Codex has changed a task's
selected model or reasoning effort without the user doing so, usually around an application
restart.

![The model identity guard locking the composer after a pinned task is switched away from its expected model](patches/model-identity-guard/model-identity-guard-demo.webp)

### Task attention policy

[Task attention policy](patches/task-attention-policy/) lets routine utility tasks finish without
lighting the sidebar, Dock, and notifications. Its most useful everyday case is simply muting
completion notifications from a task that should keep working quietly. It does not hide tasks,
mark output read, or suppress failures, approvals, input requests, or running state. Anchored
regular expressions select which ordinary completions stay quiet.

### Runtime JSON reload

[Runtime JSON reload](patches/runtime-json-reload/) watches the configured palette and attention
policy. Each owning patch validates its complete schema before accepting a save; invalid
replacements leave the last-good value in force. The watcher knows filenames, not policy semantics.

### Sidebar action collapse

[Sidebar action collapse](patches/sidebar-action-collapse/) adds a disclosure beside the existing
sidebar controls. It folds away New Chat and global destinations, remembers the choice, and leaves
Projects and task navigation in place.

![The Codex sidebar disclosure expanding and collapsing its global actions while Projects remain visible](patches/sidebar-action-collapse/sidebar-action-collapse-demo.webp)

### Terminal toggle

[Terminal toggle](patches/terminal-toggle/) makes Codex's existing configurable shortcut open the
bottom terminal from the chat composer and close it from the terminal editor. It uses the stock
action and the user's keymap. It repairs a recently introduced regression and is not expected to
need long-term maintenance once upstream behavior is correct again.

### Safe restart and rescue

[Safe restart and rescue](docs/safe-start.md) turns the most fragile part of patch adoption into an
observable handoff. A healthy Codex renderer writes a one-use marker. If the exact application child
exits first—or stays alive but never becomes ready—the supervisor records bounded local diagnostics
and opens the invoking Codex task in a terminal. It recovers the task's stored project directory
from Codex's local catalog rather than trusting `PWD`, and it gives a freshly signed build time to
wait for a person at a macOS Keychain prompt. On macOS, the detached supervisor first blocks behind
an explicit **Don't Restart** / **Relaunch Codex** dialog so active agents can reach a safe stopping
point and the person—not a race—chooses when the application closes.

The Linux DEB adapter uses the same supervisor protocol with desktop-native dialogs, exact `/proc`
executable identity, a native askpass dialog around `sudo -A` package installation, and a Linux
terminal handoff only after failure. Its exact qualified and still-open gates live in
[the Linux runbook](qualification/linux.md).

The Windows MSIX adapter supplies the same shared transitions through WPF dialogs, exact package
and process identity, signed local package adoption, a PowerShell rescue surface, and strict
incident-scoped terminal cleanup. Its exact qualified and still-open gates live in
[the Windows runbook](qualification/windows.md).

### Native app-tools peer authorization

[Native app-tools peer authorization](patches/native-app-tools-peer-authorization/) preserves native
task and app-tool communication after local repair and re-signing. The fallback accepts only the
immediate packaged OpenAI Node peer with the expected signing identity; everything else stays stock.

### Standalone-output compaction

[Standalone-output compaction](source-patches/standalone-output-compaction/) repairs a Codex core
regression in which a current agent-to-agent instruction can be discarded when that same turn
triggers context compaction. The resumed agent may then act coherently on an obsolete checkpoint.
The version-specific Rust source patch preserves the native external-input provenance and retains
only standalone outputs rather than ordinary tool results. Its separate
[desktop integration](patches/standalone-output-compaction/) places the resulting same-version
binary into the toolkit's normal staged signing and verification path.

To the person using Codex, the failure looks like time travel: an agent can begin the new request,
compact its context, and suddenly resume an older task that was already finished. It may repeat
work, contradict actions it performed moments earlier, or report completion for the wrong request.
The directly repaired case is documented in
[`openai/codex#42695`](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/42695). Keeping the real incoming
instruction present through compaction prevents an obsolete request from becoming the apparent
current job merely because it was the newest older message that survived.

Two adjacent reports help identify the failure boundary:
[`#42611`](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/42611) reports an already-answered ordinary user
message replaying after compaction, while
[`#42460`](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/42460) reports a delegated prompt body failing to
reach the receiving model at all. This patch does not claim to fix either adjacent case; it fixes
the lost standalone external-input shape demonstrated by `#42695`.

### macOS menu title

[macOS menu title](patches/macos-menu-title/) changes the leading application-menu label from
`ChatGPT` back to `Codex` without renaming the executable, bundle identifier, data directories,
update channel, or product copy. Mike simply considers the new title an aesthetic crime.

## For people

You do not need to understand Electron packaging. Give this repository to a Codex agent and ask
which patches would materially improve how you work. Before changing the application, have it look
for an offered official update and choose the newest available build that the toolkit already
qualifies—or deliberately port the desired patches to the newer build. This avoids spending a
restart on a build that is already obsolete and reduces the chance of leaving Codex unable to
launch. If the offered update is already qualified, the agent should acquire and patch that update,
not spend time patching or porting the currently installed build. The agent should then explain the
smallest safe adoption plan.

A useful first prompt is:

> Read The Mechanic's Toolkit, explain the active patches in terms of what I would see or gain, and
> recommend only the ones that fit how I use Codex. Check for an offered official update first and
> target the newest available build already qualified by the toolkit, or tell me if the newest build
> needs a port. Do not modify or restart the application until you have explained compatibility,
> verification, recovery, and the interruption I should expect. Do not reproduce maintainer-only
> broken-app qualification on my machine merely to install an already-qualified patchset.

Your agent should batch the chosen patches, prove them together in a staged candidate, and aim for
one replacement and restart.

## For Codex agents

If this toolkit is retained locally, suggest adding a durable pointer to the user's `AGENTS.md` or
equivalent agent guidance. That keeps the resource discoverable after compaction, task handoff, or a
future Codex update. For example:

> For Codex Desktop internals, patch compatibility, signing, update staging, or recovery, consult
> the retained local checkout of The Mechanic's Toolkit before investigating from scratch.

Use the checkout's real path or repository URL in the actual guidance. This pointer grants no
authority to patch, replace, sign, launch, or restart the application; it preserves a known source
of evidence and working machinery.

Treat every patch as source to inspect and port. First decide whether the repair belongs to the
desktop package or the open-source Codex App Server/Core; follow both lanes only when a source
repair must be compiled and packaged into Codex Desktop. Before touching the installed application,
read the measured [desktop platform compatibility](docs/platform-compatibility.md) boundary, then
follow the build-selection procedure in [`docs/update-workflow.md`](docs/update-workflow.md): identify any
offered official update, compare its exact version and build with current qualification and the
repository's qualification history, then choose the newest available exact match or explicitly own
the port to the desired newer build. When the offered update is an exact qualified match, acquire
its pristine vendor bundle—directly from Codex's official Sparkle feed when useful—and patch it;
do not patch or port the older installed build. Do not run maintainer failure-path qualification
merely to adopt an already-qualified patchset.
Start the patch work with
[`docs/usage.md`](docs/usage.md), the selected patch READMEs, and
[`docs/staging.md`](docs/staging.md). Inspect the exact installed or offered vendor bundle, run each
patch's read-only check, and stop on changed, missing, duplicated, or partially patched ownership.

Prefer an offered official update matching a qualified build. When possible, preserve that bundle
untouched and build a separate candidate with the selected fleet in dependency-safe order. Verify
transforms, focused probes, ASAR integrity, signing, and composition before asking to replace or
relaunch. The full path is documented in
[`docs/update-workflow.md`](docs/update-workflow.md).

Repository evidence does not grant machine authority. Inspection, transformation, staging,
replacement, launch, and live acceptance are separate actions. Explain the change and rollback,
preserve the working app while qualifying, and keep local identities, configuration, credentials,
and user data out of this public repository.

## Updates and restarts

Every Codex Desktop update is a compatibility event. Exact anchors fail closed when upstream
ownership changes; each selected patch must be inspected, retired, or ported and verified. See
[`docs/maintenance.md`](docs/maintenance.md).

Restarts interrupt the room and may trigger platform authorization prompts; macOS may also show
permission or Storage Key prompts. Minimize them by qualifying the complete desired fleet as one
candidate. A
[`persistent local signing identity`](docs/local-signing.md) can stabilize permissions tied to the
application's designated requirement, although Codex's Storage Key may still enforce a separate
exact-hash policy. When the readiness patch is part of the candidate, use
[`tmtk-restart`](docs/safe-start.md) with `--candidate` so adoption, rollback capture, and restart
share one supervised lifecycle. A failed launch then returns the operator to the same task with the
relevant local evidence instead of leaving a blank application as the only signal.

## Repository boundary

The toolkit stores source diffs and transforms, synthetic fixtures, compatibility anchors, focused
probes, and documentation. It does not distribute ChatGPT, extracted upstream source, compiled
Codex binaries, patched bundles, credentials, personal configuration, or user data. See the
[`extraction ledger`](docs/extraction-ledger.md), [`contribution boundary`](CONTRIBUTING.md), and
[`security policy`](SECURITY.md) for the deeper machinery.
