# Extraction ledger

This repository is the canonical source for the portable patches recorded below. The ledger says
what crossed the extraction boundary and is the public fleet-wide qualification record: current
static and live evidence, explicitly carried earlier live evidence, and the next useful evidence
boundary. A next boundary strengthens or refreshes the record; it is not automatically a blocker to
the qualified build named below. Raw maintainer logs and receipts remain ignored local evidence.
Patch READMEs retain patch-specific behavioral evidence without duplicating this fast-changing
record. This ledger is not a promise to publish every historical experiment.

## Current build qualification

Codex Desktop `26.908.40834` (build `8881`) for macOS ARM64 was inspected and staged on macOS
`26.6.2` (`25G83`) from a pristine vendor update, then re-staged and adopted with the current
19-patch fleet on 2026-09-14. The complete selected
desktop-package fleet—including the separately built Codex 0.154.0-alpha.6.2 binary—passed every
focused probe before and after repacking, remained byte-identical on a second application,
preserved the native package tree and executable helper, and produced a valid code signature and
ASAR seal. The accepted ASAR SHA-256 is
`9c977a8480f7c663301dd2e8086d7a1890517e39ed44a1dbaa626a9b4aee7b0c`. The supervisor installed that
exact candidate at the canonical path, proved its signature and ASAR seal, observed real renderer
readiness, and returned to the originating task without an overlapping CLI writer. Native
task-to-task messages rendered in both directions, a wait roster named its real tasks, and an
explicitly addressed same-ship Tinrelay loopback rendered and reached routed state. Live use also
accepted sidebar collapse, task-palette chips/room colors/background marks, model protection, the
macOS menu title, and terminal toggle. Build-8881 regression probes additionally cover the split
renderer message bus, renderer-store capture, outgoing-radio hoist order, restart/pagination
persistence, and composed registry ownership. Build `8881` is therefore the current qualified
fleet; the table keeps narrower live boundaries visible where they would strengthen rather than
redefine this qualification.

The Linux DEB adapter has a narrower build-`8881` qualification on Ubuntu 24.04.5 ARM64. Its exact
13-patch ASAR fleet passed source-signature verification, staging, repacking, second application,
native-payload preservation, supervised installation, exact invoking-CLI exit, and real renderer
readiness. The genuine Luna task reopened from Recents with its model and reasoning selection, and
no supervisor, rescue agent, or toolkit-owned terminal remained. This proves healthy adoption and
real-task CLI/Desktop non-overlap for that recorded environment; controlled blank/Oops recovery,
exhaustion and known-good restoration, and per-feature Linux live checks remain open. Exact package
hashes and runbook boundaries are recorded in
[platform compatibility](platform-compatibility.md#linux-build-8881-implementation-checkpoint) and
[Linux qualification](../qualification/linux.md).

The qualified desktop fleet was staged with these exact package patches:

```json
[
  "cross-task-attribution",
  "runtime-json-reload",
  "agent-roster",
  "task-visual-palette",
  "reasoning-retention",
  "model-identity-guard",
  "macos-menu-title",
  "standalone-output-compaction",
  "sidebar-action-collapse",
  "task-attention-policy",
  "terminal-toggle",
  "outgoing-message-receipt",
  "wait-thread-roster",
  "tinrelay-pointer-presentation",
  "native-app-tools-peer-authorization",
  "codex-observability",
  "renderer-turn-window",
  "safe-start-readiness",
  "renderer-patch-registry"
]
```

`standalone-output-compaction` integrated the separately built Codex 0.154.0-alpha.6.2 source repair named
above. Private paths and user policy are intentionally absent from this public record. A subset on
the same vendor build inherits only its selected patches' exact source recognition and recorded
patch-specific evidence; it must satisfy catalog dependencies, pass staging as that subset, and
receive its own focused live checks. It is not the full-fleet composition receipt merely because it
contains fewer transforms.

The predecessor qualifications remain useful evidence. Build `8576` launched with the complete
fleet and supplied the live evidence named above. Build `8109` launched successfully, and the
configured palette, sidebar, terminal, retained reasoning, native task messaging, and incoming and
outgoing Tinrelay presentation were exercised in live use.

## Extraction rule

A slice moves only when it has one portable owner, no personal path or identity data, a focused
probe, an explicit compatibility claim, and a failure mode that leaves the operator's working
application untouched. Until then, copying source is not adoption.
