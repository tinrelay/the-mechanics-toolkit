# Maintaining patches across Codex updates

Codex Desktop updates replace the packaged implementation that its transforms recognize and may
also change the bundled open-source Codex revision. Treat every new version and build as unsupported
until the selected desktop and source patch fleets have been examined against it.

When the vendor artifact for an offered update is available, perform this work before interrupting
the current Codex. Keep the vendor artifact untouched, stage the patched candidate separately, and
defer the one quit-and-relaunch seam until static proof is complete. On macOS, follow
[preparing a patched Codex update](macos-update-workflow.md) and do not install a second live
application with the same bundle identity.

For each carried patch, first identify whether its owner is the desktop package under `patches/` or
the App Server/Core source under `source-patches/`. A source repair may require both a new Rust port
and its stable desktop binary-integration step.

Then:

1. inspect the current upstream owner and the behavior visible to the user;
2. retire the local implementation when upstream now satisfies its contract;
3. port the transform and refresh its exact anchors when the repair is still needed;
4. stop when ownership moved and the new seam is not yet understood;
5. for source patches, run the focused Rust tests and build the exact bundled CLI version;
6. run focused probes and the complete selected desktop fleet against a pristine staged copy;
7. perform narrow live checks before treating the rebuilt application as accepted.

## Complete the port record

A port is not complete merely because its candidate launched. In the same reviewed change that
records the accepted source:

1. bump `package.json` and `package-lock.json` when the supported release contract changes, and put
   the matching current entry first in `UPGRADING.md`;
2. update the root README's current platform summary;
3. update the current build matrix and evidence in
   [`extraction-ledger.md`](extraction-ledger.md);
4. update the platform qualification runbook with exact hashes and deliberately unrun gates;
5. remove superseded generated profiles, source diffs, config examples, obsolete current-state
   prose, and empty port directories unless a current compatibility requirement explicitly owns
   them;
6. give platform-specific files, commands, examples, and documents an explicit platform or package
   format name and place them under the corresponding directory; and
7. close the campaign workbench with exactly one pristine package and one current candidate. Remove
   failed packages, superseded candidates, extracted package trees, and transaction-only rollback
   artifacts while retaining compact receipts, hashes, and source identity.

`npm test` runs the repository-hygiene probe that enforces version alignment, the current
`UPGRADING.md` entry, platform-named examples, relative Markdown links, fenced JSON, centralized
build claims, and the exact source-patch catalog. Do not merge or publish a completed port while
that probe fails or while current-state surfaces still name the prior build.

Do not loosen an anchor until it happens to match or treat a green transform as proof of behavior.
Stable behavior and focused verification belong in the patch README. The root README gives the
short current platform summary; the current build matrix, fleet-wide evidence, and next
qualification boundary belong in the [extraction ledger](extraction-ledger.md).

State words in the maintenance records are dispositions, not marketing promises:

- **Active** — the repair still earns its cost on the current qualified build;
- **Benched** — retained machinery has no configured job;
- **Upstream-owned** — stock Codex now satisfies the accepted contract, so the local transform is
  dormant;
- **Infrastructure** — a supporting seam with no user-facing behavior of its own.

An upstream-owned patch is useful history and a regression oracle, not part of the default staging
fleet. A benched patch should remain excluded until a real job justifies reactivating it.
